1.  Preconditions
	In order to run this tool set you need to have the IPFIX library to be
	'build'. Building the library ('./configure && make') is enough you don't
	need to have it installed. To use 'ipfixfromfile' you need 'netcat'. On
	debian based systems it can be installed by typing 'sudo apt-get install
	netcat-openbsd'. When you don't have a debian based system build it from
	the sources or install it with your package-manager of trust.

2.  Reexporter
2.1 What is?
	The reexporter is a tool to reexport templates that come from 'impd4e'
	probes. It happens that different probes assign the same template ID to
	different templates and the reexporter fixes this issue and writes the
	IPFIX packets to files.
2.2 How it works
    The reexporter application consists of two threads, the reexporter itself
    and thread2 which writes the collected IPFIX messages "intelligently" into
    a file. Figure 1 shows how it looks like.

                    Fig.1 The reexporter architecture
	
    Intelligent writing means, no IPFIX messages are cut into pieces. When the
    current file reaches a defined file size thread2 doesn't close the
    file until all data from the last message is written to the file
2.3 Parameters
	Different command line parameters can be set:
		-s [chunk size]
		-p [port] 
		-f [path/filename]
		-g [host]
	The parameter '-s' defines the size of the IPFIX files in Mebibytes.
	Parameter '-p' defines the port to listen on. The probes connect by default
	to port 4739, but sometimes this port is already in use, so an other one
    can be selected. Setting parameter '-f' defines the path and the name of the
	file prefix for the output files, e.g. '/home/user/test'. The files always
	get a time stamp with resolution of seconds. When more than one file is
	created in one second the last index is incremented by 1. A file created
	on the 18th of may 2011 at 15o'clock 20 minutes and 34 seconds is called
	'record_18.05.11_15_29_34_0'.
	The last parameter ('-g') is a little bit difficult to understand. When this
    parameter is set, Thread2 won't be active, instead, the reexporter forwards
    all reeexported IPFIX messages to a remotely listening collector (e.g. the 
    matcher or the example collector).

3.  IPFIXtoFile
3.1 What is?
    This application writes data from a single probe into a set of files. No
    reexporting is done, since same template ID from different probes can't
    happen.
3.2 How it works   
    When we only have one probe, and want to write the incoming traffic from
    that probe into a file, we don't need to reexport the data, we just need a
    file writer. In this case the architecture looks like in figure 2.

           Fig.1 The ipfixtofile architecture
    
    With the '#define SINGLEFLOW' thread2 is adapted that it works for both
    cases.
3.3 Parameters
    The filesize ('-s'), portnumber ('-p') and the path+filename ('-f') can be
    set, much like the in the reexporter.
    
4.  IPFIXfromFile
4.1 What is?
	The 'ipfixfromfile' is a small application to resend a set of previously
	recorded IPFIX messages from a bunch of files to a defined destination.
4.2 Parameters
	The default values are collector ip address is '127.0.0.1' and the default
	port is 4739. Both parameters can be changed, e.g.
	'./ipfixfromfile 192.168.2.12 4812'
	When the port should be changed the ip address also has to be set.

6.  Information
    This software was created to record IPFIX tracking data without the need
    to run the matcher or netview. The idea for this tool set came from Carsten
    Schmoll , who also supervised me during my work and gave me good advises to
    'finish' this application.
